SLOW START-UP WARNING!!!

For reasons beyond my control, the compiled version (.exe) of StyleStripper may start slowly--as in, you launch it, wait 30-45 seconds, and then the application appears. This is caused by a virus scanner picking slowly through the code to make sure it's not doing something nefarious.

Yes, that's a good thing, but it sure can be annoying!

If you really hate waiting, here are two options to consider:

* Configure your virus scanner and mark the StyleStripper.exe as known good

* Run the Python source code up on GitHub directly instead of launching the .exe file

My apologies and best wishes,
